Code to store data to flash memory, so that flash memory can be used as non-volatile memory.
I have used the library by ControllerTech to write data to 11th sector of STM32F4 discovery board.

I just faced one issue that after first time the code had to be uploaded via stm32 utility in the discovery board as programming using the cube ide had issues.
